JDBC: java data base connectivity
    : it acts like a mediator /translator
    : it is a library(java.sql package)
    : used to connect java application to db and vice versa
    
Steps:
------
		1.load and register : Loading and registering the driver class
		  -(driver)download link: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/mysql/mysql-connector-java/8.0.29
		  -after downloading copy into your project
		  -then set jar file into your projects
		  -steps:
		       1.right click on project
		       2.build path--->configure build path
		       3.in libraries-->add jar-->select and apply and close.
		 
		2.Establish the connection: connecting java application with respective database
		     url:  jdbc:mysql: //  localhost:  3306     / db_Name/Schema_Name
		            protocol       Domain_Name  portNumber
		
		3.creation of Statement: creating statement objects
		         Statement -i  --static query/commands
		             |
		             | 
		         PreparedStatement-i -static and dynamic queries/commands
		             |
		             |
		         CallableStatement-i -static and dynamic queries/command along with it helps to
		                              execute stored procedures and functions
		
		  
		4.Execution of Statement : executing the statement objects
		    boolean execute(); --it executes both DML(data manipulation language-insert, update ,delete)-returns false 
		                         and DQL(data query language- fetch)-returns true
		                         
		    int executeUpdate()-it executes DML -- return number based on no.of rows manipulated
		    
		    ResultSet executeQuery()-it execute DQL--returns data 
		
		
		
		5.close :closing resources  - to avoid connection pool
