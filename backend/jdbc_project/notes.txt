------
		1.load and register : Loading and registering the driver class
		  -(driver)download link: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/mysql/mysql-connector-java/8.0.29
		  -after downloading copy into your project
		  -then set jar file into your projects
		  -steps:

		         CallableStatement-i -static and dynamic queries/command along with it helps to
		                              execute stored procedures and functions
