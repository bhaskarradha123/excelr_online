Java:
-----
    -java is a programming language
    -java is a high level language, object oriented language,
     class based language
    -java is a platform independent language
    - we can develop desktop application ,web application, mobile application etc


History:
-------
    -java was developed in 1991 by  sun micro system 
              -james gosling(green team)
              -patrick
              -Mike
            
    -java was introduced in 1995 by james gosling(father of java)
    -in the year of 1996 they released java 1.0(jdk 1.0)
         jdk-java development kit
         jre-java runtime environment
         jvm-java virtual machine

jdk-it consist of jre  and development tools
jre-it consist of jvm and set of libraries
jvm-it consist of bytecode interpreter  , used to execute bytecode



platform independent:
---------------------
     - it means write code once run anywhere(WORA)
     - to execute a java file we need 
         1.compiler:
                   - it is a tool which converts source code into byte code
                   - ___.java(source code) ----->____.class(bytecode)

         2.interpreter:
                   - it is a jvm which executes bytecode

Note : java is a platform independent but jvm dependent

java features:
-------------
1.platform independent
2.object oriented:
               1.inheritance
               2.polymorphism
               3.encapsulation
               4.abstraction
3.java is simple and easy to learn
4.java is secure :
               -no pointers, which eliminate the need for memory management
               -java has a inbuilt security manager which prevents
                 unauthorised access to the system
5.java is robust:
                 -strong management of memory
                 -it has a garbage collector which deletes
                  unused objects
6.java is multi threaded
                - supports multi threading, allowing you to run 
                 multiple tasks at the same time
7.java is dynamic language and case sensitive
8.java has rich standard library
