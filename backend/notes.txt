Java:
-----
    -java is a programming language
    -java is a high level language, object oriented language,
     class based language
    -java is a platform independent language
    - we can develop desktop application ,web application, mobile application etc


History:
-------
    -java was developed in 1991 by  sun micro system 
              -james gosling(green team)
              -patrick
              -Mike
            
    -java was introduced in 1995 by james gosling(father of java)
    -in the year of 1996 they released java 1.0(jdk 1.0)
         jdk-java development kit
         jre-java runtime environment
         jvm-java virtual machine

jdk-it consist of jre  and development tools
jre-it consist of jvm and set of libraries
jvm-it consist of bytecode interpreter  , used to execute bytecode



platform independent:
---------------------
     - it means write code once run anywhere(WORA)
     - to execute a java file we need 
         1.compiler:
                   - it is a tool which converts source code into byte code
                   - ___.java(source code) ----->____.class(bytecode)

         2.interpreter:
                   - it is a jvm which executes bytecode

Note : java is a platform independent but jvm dependent

java features:
-------------
1.platform independent
2.object oriented:
               1.inheritance
               2.polymorphism
               3.encapsulation
               4.abstraction
3.java is simple and easy to learn
4.java is secure :
               -no pointers, which eliminate the need for memory management
               -java has a inbuilt security manager which prevents
                 unauthorised access to the system
5.java is robust:
                 -strong management of memory
                 -it has a garbage collector which deletes
                  unused objects
6.java is multi threaded
                - supports multi threading, allowing you to run 
                 multiple tasks at the same time
7.java is dynamic language and case sensitive
8.java has rich standard library
------------------------------------------------------------------------

java structure:
---------------

   class className{
    
    public static void main(String[]args){
        ------
        ------
        ------
        }
    }

Note : main method is the entry point of java program
       without main method java program will not run but we can compile
         
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tokens :
      - tokens are the basic building blocks of a java program
      - tokens are used to define the structure of a java program
      - tokens are the elements of a java program 
      - types :
              1.keywords
                        :inbuilt words and reserved words
                        :all keywords are in lowercase
                    ex: public static void if else for while switch case 

              2.identifiers
                       : names providing by programmer or developer
                       
                Rules:(mandatory)
                       : keywords cannot be used as identifiers
                       : identifiers are not start with digits and 
                         special characters except $ and _
                Conventions:(optional but recommended)
                       : identifiers should be in camel case
                       ex: firstNameProgram
                       : for class/interface name use pascal case
                       ex: FirstNameProgram
                       : for method and variable name use snake case/camel case
                       ex: first_name

              3.literals
                        : literal is a value/data assigned to a variable

                ex:    int        valueName        =        10
                     datatype    identifier   assigning   value/literal

Data types:
           1.primitive data types

                4.long  - 8 bytes - 64 bits  -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807
                5.float - 4 bytes - 32 bits  -3.4E38 to 3.4E38
                6.double- 8 bytes - 64 bits  -1.7E308 to 1.7E308
                7.char  - 2 bytes - 16 bits  -32768 to 32767
                8.boolean - 1 byte - 8 bits  -true or false
           2.non primitive data types
                1.string
                2.array
                3.object
                4.wrapper classes
                5.enum
                6.annotation
                7.Collections
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
variables:
-----------
        - variables are used to store data/ values

      based on datatype:  
        - if we storing primitive datatype then it is called primitive variable
            int a=10;   (a- primitive variable)
        - if we storing non primitive datatype then it is called non primitive variable
            String b="hello";  (b- non primitive variable)

      based on scope:
        - if we storing variable inside method/constructor then it is called local variable
         Note : local variable can be accessed only inside method/constructor but not outside
        - if we storing variable inside class and outside method then it is called global variable
         Note : global variable can be accessed inside and outside method
                global variables are two types:   1.static variable
                     2.instance/non static variable
                  
                  




              4.operators
              5.separators
Note : tokens are case sensitive
