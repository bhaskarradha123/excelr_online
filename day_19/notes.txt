object :
    -it is a collection of related data and functions
    -it is a collection of properties and methods
    -it is a collection of variables and functions
    -it indicates real time entity
ex:
       dog :
            data/properties/variables:name ,color, age ,breed ,height
            actions/behavior/functions/methods:barking, eating, running,jumping
       function dog(variable_1, variable_2){
            this.name=variable_1;
            this.color=variable_2;
            this.propertyName=variableName;
            
            function barking(){
                
            }
       }

 Note : in js every object has a prototype
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------      

prototype:
    -it is a property of an object
    -it allows other object to inherit properties and methods
    -it is used to add new properties and methods to an object
    -this created a prototype chain between objects
                   :allows objects to share properties and methods
